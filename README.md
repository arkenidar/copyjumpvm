# copyjumpvm
"copy+jump only" virtual machine

Dario Cangialosi (Coder) says: https://github.com/arkenidar/copyjumpvm I had been working on these kind of project for a "microcode-based virtual machine" for a testing benchmark for applying "code compression" code optimization techniques, since the microcode format allows for fine-grained mutations and then fine-grained optimizations by rewriting. The smallest grain is a 1 bit copy operation followed by a Instruction Pointer assignment (jump) by choice of 2 given option values selected by a fixedly positioned path-selector bit. At the following (arkenidar/copyjumpvm) link you can see 2 program formats examples (textual format and numeric/tabular format) and the VM here linked can execute numeric tabular formatted microcode (*.cj). Other my GitHub projects are similar, but at times different, explorations (e.g. arkenidar / CopyJumpMachine can execute textual format micro-programs, and then can be a easier starting point for building. arkenidar / simple has a brute force discovery of programs that produce a given output, feature useful for a code compression challenge where the code should work as a data decompressor when executed, so a decompressor program should be found or synthesized)
